Wordstreamify
=============

This plugin is a ruby on rails wrapper around the Wordstream API (www.wordstream.com). Its goal is to facilitate the integration of the Wordstream API in Rails application. RubyRescue (http://rubyrescue.com) ask me once to integrate the API to an app and so i did, and decided to make a plugin out of it. It's a work in progress as  all the API functions has not been implemented yet :-)

Wordstreamify
=============

This plugin is a ruby on rails wrapper around the Wordstream API (www.wordstream.com). Its goal is to facilitate the integration of the Wordstream API in Rails application. RubyRescue (http://rubyrescue.com) ask me once to integrate the API to an app and so i did, and decided to make a plugin out of it. It's a work in progress but the main API function has been implemented â€¦

For now it's a 'eager loading' plugin making its methods available to all your Model Class, the next iteration will make it a lazy loading plugin and will be tagged accordingly. So you'll have the choice between the two.
